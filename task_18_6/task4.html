        <img src="./jack.png" alt="Jack"/>
        <p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an <br/>
        empty box for his birthday. He may <em>look</em> happy, but <br/>
        he's a <em>little</em> disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few <br/>
        things in the box.</p>
        <br/>
        Jack would really like...
        <ul>
            <li>Roller blades</li>
            <li>Magic tricks</li>
            <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
            <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
        </ul>
        You can get all this (and more) at an online toy <br/>
        store. Two very popular ones are <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/" target="_blank">toysrus.com</a>
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EToys.com" target="_blank">etoys</a>.
